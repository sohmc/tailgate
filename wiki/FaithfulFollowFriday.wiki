#Project page for Faithful Follow Friday

= Version 0.2 Released =

I've updated the script to use [http://oauth.net/ OAuth], as [http://dev.twitter.com/announcements required by Twitter].  The script uses [http://twitter.com/abraham @abraham]'s [http://github.com/abraham/twitteroauth twitteroauth].  For your convienence, I've put a [http://tailgate.googlecode.com/files/abraham-twitteroauth-0.2.0-beta2-0-g35fa109.tar.gz copy] under the [http://code.google.com/p/tailgate/downloads/list Downloads] tab above.  I've only tested it using 0.2.0-beta2.

As of right now, you will need your own [http://dev.twitter.com/apps application OAuth keys].  I'll write some more detailed directions later on.

== Documentation ==

The #followfriday format should look like this:
{{{
#followfriday #sometag #othertag @twitter @twitterapi @twitter @etc...
#followfriday #anothertag @abc123 @def456...
}}}

Each #followfriday *category* should have their own line.  So don't use a program that inserts a line-break after so many characters.
