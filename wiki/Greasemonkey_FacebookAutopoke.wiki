This [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748/ Greasemonkey script] 
automatically pokes people who have already poked you on
Facebook.  It was inspired by Lukas Fragodt's Auto-Poke and EZ-Poke
script, which are now defunct.

== Welcome to version 3.0 == 
I was hoping to release version 3.0 later in the year but Facebook 
forced me to move my time table.  In case you have missed the 
conversation, [http://userscripts.org/topics/54659 Facebook has changed the way that pokes are processed.]

*This script works for ENGLISH ONLY!*  If you would like to help
making this script more language-independent, please send me a
[http://userscripts.org/messages/new?user_id=7743 direct message].

This script is likely to break again very soon.  The way Facebook made
their change allows them to change ONE variable to make this script
obsolete.  I'm working on this and will keep a close eye on any
changes Facebook may make.  Please be patient with me, but feel free
to [http://userscripts.org/scripts/discuss/5200 submit a bug report in the forums].

== Developers: please read this! == 
If you plan on using my method to process pokes, please leave a message in the
forums.  I believe Facebook is attempting to prevent autopoke scripts such as
this from automating the poke process.  Leaving a message will allow me to see
how many people are using the script.  And as always, please remember to
attribute.
